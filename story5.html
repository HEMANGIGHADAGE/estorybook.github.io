<H3>THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPPER</H3>
<P>Once upon a time, there were two best friends – an ant and a grasshopper.<BR>
 The grasshopper liked to relax the whole day and play his guitar. <BR> 
The ant, however, would work hard all day.<BR>
 He would collect food from all corners of the garden, while the grasshopper relaxed, played his guitar, or slept. <BR>
<BR>
The grasshopper would tell the ant to take a break every day, but the ant would refuse and continue his work. <BR>
Soon, winter came; days and nights became cold and very few creatures went out.

On a cold day of winter, a colony of ants was busy drying out some grains of corn<BR>
. The half-dead grasshopper, cold and hungry, came up to the ant who was his friend and asked for a piece of corn. <BR>
The ant replied, “We work day and night to collect and save up the corn so that we don’t die hungry on cold winter days.<BR>
 Why should we give it to you?” The ant further asked, “What were you doing last summer? You should have collected and stored some food.<BR>
 I told you as much before.”

The grasshopper said, “I was far too busying singing and sleeping.”

The ant replied, “You can sing all winter as far as I am concerned. <BR>
You will not get anything from us.”<BR>
 The ant had enough food to last through the winter, without any worries at all, but the grasshopper didn’t and he realised his mistake.<BR>
