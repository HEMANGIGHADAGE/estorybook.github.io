<h3>THE FOX AND THE GRAPES</H3>
<p>On a hot summer day, a fox wandered across the jungle in order to get some food.<br>
 He was very hungry and desperately in search of food. <br>
He searched everywhere, but couldn’t find anything that he could eat.<br>
 His stomach was rumbling and his search continued.<br>
 Soon he reached a vineyard which was laden with juicy grapes. <br>
The fox looked around to check if he was safe from the hunters.<br>
 No one was around, so he decided to steal some grapes.<br>
 He jumped high and high, but he couldn’t reach the grapes.<br>
 The grapes were too high but he refused to give up.<br>
 The fox jumped high in the air to catch the grapes in his mouth, but he missed. <br>
He tried once more but missed again.<br>
 He tried a few more times, but couldn’t reach.<br>
 It was getting dark and the fox was getting angry.<br>
 His legs hurt, so he gave up in the end.<br>
 Walking away, he said, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.”<br><br>
<B>MORAL: We pretend to hate something when we can’t have it.<B>
