<H3>The bear and two friends</H3>
<P>
One day, two best friends were walking on a lonely and dangerous path through a jungle.<br>
 As the sun began to set, they grew afraid but held on to each other.<br>
 Suddenly, they saw a bear in their path.<br>
 One of the boys ran to the nearest tree and climbed it in a jiffy.<br>
 The other boy did not know how to climb the tree by himself, so he lay on the ground, pretending to be dead. <br>
The bear approached the boy on the ground and sniffed around his head. <br>
After appearing to whisper something in the boy’s ear, the bear went on its way. <br>
The boy on the tree climbed down and asked his friend what the bear had whispered in his ear.<br>
 He replied, “Do not trust friends who do not care for you.”<br>

<B>MORAL:A friend in need is a friend indeed <B>
