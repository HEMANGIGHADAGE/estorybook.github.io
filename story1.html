<h3>THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE</h3>
<p>Once, a hare saw a tortoise walking slowly with a heavy shell on his back. <br>
The hare was very proud of himself and he asked the tortoise. â€œShall we have a race?"<br>
The tortoise agreed. They started the running race. The hare ran very fast.<br>
 But the tortoise walked very slowly. The proud hair rested under a tree and soon slept off.<br>
 But the tortoise walked very fast, slowly and steadily and reached the goal.<br>
 At last, the tortoise won the race.<br>
<b>Moral : Slow and steady wins the race.</b>
