<H3>The Woodcutter and the Golden Axe</H3>
<P>
There was once a woodcutter, working hard in the forest, getting wood to sell for some food.<BR> 
As he was cutting a tree, his axe accidentally fell into the river. <BR>
The river was deep and was flowing really fast – he lost his axe and could not find it again.<BR>
 He sat at the bank of the river and wept.<BR>

While he wept, the God of the river arose and asked him what happened.<BR>
 The woodcutter told him the story.<BR>
 The God of the river offered to help him by looking for his axe.<BR>
 He disappeared into the river and retrieved a golden axe, but the woodcutter said it was not his.<BR>
 He disappeared again and came back with a silver axe, but the woodcutter said that was not his either.<BR>
 The God disappeared into the water again and came back with an iron axe – the woodcutter smiled and said it was his.<BR>
 The God was impressed with the woodcutter’s honesty and gifted him both the golden and silver axes.<br>
<B>MORAL: Honesty is the best policy <B>
