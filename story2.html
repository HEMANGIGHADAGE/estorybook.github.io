<h3>THE LION AND THE MOUSE</h3>
<p> A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up and down his body just for fun.<br> This disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he woke up quite angry.<br> He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse desperately requested the lion to set him free.<br> “I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me.”<br> The lion laughed at the mouse’s confidence and let him go.<br>
<br>One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the lion with them.<br> They tied him up against a tree.<br> The lion was struggling to get out and started to whimper.<br> Soon, the mouse walked past and noticed the lion in trouble.<br> Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the ropes to set the lion free.<br> Both of them sped off into the jungle</p><br>
