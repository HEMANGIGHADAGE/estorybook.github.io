<H3>THE GOLDEN TOUCH</H3>
<P>Once there lived a greedy man in a small town. <br> 
He was very rich, and he loved gold and all things fancy. <br>
 But he loved his daughter more than anything.<br>
 One day, he chanced upon a fairy.<br>
 The fairy’s hair was caught in a few tree branches. <br>
He helped her out, but as his greediness took over,<br>
 he realised that he had an opportunity to become richer by asking for a wish in return (by helping her out). <br>
The fairy granted him a wish. He said, “All that I touch should turn to gold.” And his wish was granted by the grateful fairy.
The greedy man rushed home to tell his wife and daughter about his wish,<br>
 all the while touching stones and pebbles and watching them convert into gold.<br>
 Once he got home, his daughter rushed to greet him.<br>
 As soon as he bent down to scoop her up in his arms, she turned into a gold statue.<br>
 He was devastated and started crying and trying to bring his daughter back to life.<br>
 He realised his folly and spent the rest of his days searching for the fairy to take away his wish.
